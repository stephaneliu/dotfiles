# Swamp Club scorecard rubric — complete reference

The rubric evaluates an extension against 12 factors, totaling 15 points. The
displayed percentage is `floor(earned * 100 / 15)`. The letter grade is derived
from the percentage.

## Grade thresholds

| Grade | Range |
| ----- | ----- |
| A     | ≥ 90% |
| B     | ≥ 75% |
| C     | ≥ 60% |
| D     | ≥ 40% |
| F     | < 40% |

## Score ceilings

| Extension type                  | Ceiling      | Why                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Third-party, all factors earned | 14/15 = 93%  | `verified-by-swamp` is unearnable without admin review |
| First-party (`@swamp/*`)        | 15/15 = 100% | First-party namespace auto-earns `verified-by-swamp`   |
| Admin-curated third-party       | 15/15 = 100% | Admin review endpoint earns the factor                 |

## Per-factor reference

### `has-readme` (2 pts)

Earned when the tarball contains a README file. The analyzer looks at:

1. `<logical root>/README.md` (and `.MD`, and `readme.md`)
2. `<logical root>/files/README.md` (same case variants)

The second location is where files listed in `manifest.yaml`'s
`additionalFiles:` field land. Both lookups are exact at this level — the
analyzer does NOT recurse, so a nested entry like
`additionalFiles: [docs/README.md]` lands at `<root>/files/docs/README.md` and
earns zero. Use a bare basename and, if your source layout requires it, opt into
`paths.base: manifest`.

### `readme-example` (1 pt)

Earned when the README contains at least one fenced code block. Detection is
regex-based:

````
^```[word characters or -]*\s*\n[any content]\n```
````

Any language tag (or no language tag) counts.

### `rich-readme` (1 pt)

Earned when **both** conditions hold:

- README length ≥ 500 characters (raw byte count of the decoded file)
- README contains ≥ 2 fenced code blocks (same regex as above)

A README that is 499 characters or has exactly one code block earns 0 for this
factor. It is deliberately cheap to clear; any substantive README satisfies it.

### `symbols-docs` (1 pt)

Earned when at least 80% of exported symbols across the declared entrypoints
have a JSDoc comment. Computed via `deno doc --json`:
`documentedExports / totalExports ≥ 0.80`.

Counting rules:

- Only exported symbols count.
- Each symbol is counted once per declaration (function overloads count as
  separate declarations).
- A symbol is "documented" if its `jsDoc.doc` field is a non-empty string.
- Types, interfaces, classes, functions, and constants all count.

### `fast-check` (1 pt)

Earned when `deno doc --lint <entrypoints>` produces zero slow-type diagnostics.
Slow-type diagnostic codes include:

- `missing-return-type`
- `missing-explicit-type`
- `private-type-ref`
- `unsupported-ambient-module`
- `unsupported-complex-reference`
- `unsupported-default-export-expr`
- `unsupported-destructuring`
- `unsupported-global-module`
- `unsupported-require`
- `unsupported-ts-export-assignment`
- `unsupported-ts-instantiation-expression`
- `unsupported-ts-namespace-export`
- `unsupported-using-stmt`

A single diagnostic of any of these codes costs the whole point.

### `description` (1 pt)

Earned when the `description` field on the extension record is a non-empty
string. The CLI populates this from `manifest.yaml`'s `description:` field
during push. Owners can also edit it post-publish via the Swamp Club owner
panel.

### `platforms-one` (1 pt)

Earned when **either**:

- `platforms:` has at least one entry, OR
- `platforms:` is empty (an empty array is treated as "supports all platforms",
  which is strictly more permissive than any explicit list)

### `platforms-two` (1 pt)

Same rule, but the array must have ≥ 2 entries (or be empty).

An array of exactly one platform fails this factor because it is a more
restrictive declaration than "universal". This is intentional — an author who
has tested on multiple platforms is more trusted than one who has tested on
exactly one.

### `has-license` (1 pt)

Earned when **either**:

- The extension's `license` field is a non-empty trimmed string (set via PATCH
  on the extension record), OR
- The tarball contains a license file at `<root>/*` or `<root>/files/*`

Both lookups are exact at this level — the analyzer does NOT recurse, so a
nested entry like `additionalFiles: [legal/LICENSE]` lands at
`<root>/files/legal/LICENSE` and earns zero. Use a bare basename and, if your
source layout requires it, opt into `paths.base: manifest`.

Recognized license filenames (case-sensitive matches):

```
LICENSE, LICENSE.md, LICENSE.txt, LICENSE.MD, LICENSE.TXT,
License, License.md, License.txt,
license, license.md, license.txt,
COPYING, COPYING.md, COPYING.txt
```

### `repository-verified` (2 pts)

Earned when the `repository:` URL points to a public repository on an
allowlisted host, confirmed via that host's public API.

Allowlisted hosts and the API endpoints used:

| Host            | API endpoint                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `github.com`    | `GET https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo`                   |
| `gitlab.com`    | `GET https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/:encoded-path`            |
| `codeberg.org`  | `GET https://codeberg.org/api/v1/repos/:owner/:repo`              |
| `bitbucket.org` | `GET https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/:workspace/:repo` |

The URL is parsed to extract owner/repo (nested group paths supported for
GitLab). A 200 response with the repo reporting itself public earns the factor.
404, private, rate-limited, or any network error means not verified.

Self-hosted Git (GitHub Enterprise, self-hosted GitLab, private Gitea, Azure
DevOps, Bitbucket Server) cannot earn this factor — verification requires the
public API, which only the SaaS instances of those four hosts expose.

Verification is cached for 7 days on the extension record. URL changes clear the
cache and trigger re-verification.

### `dependency-trust` (2 pts)

Earned when all npm dependencies pass the supply-chain trust gates. The CLI
extracts `npm:` and `jsr:` import specifiers from extension source files and
audits them against OSV.dev advisories and the npm registry.

**Blockers (prevent push and fail the factor):**

- HIGH or CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities (from OSV.dev)
- Deprecated packages (npm registry `deprecated` field)

**Warnings (displayed but do not block):**

- MEDIUM severity vulnerabilities
- Low weekly downloads (< 1000)
- Stale last-publish (> 2 years)
- Non-OSI-approved license
- Single maintainer

jsr packages trust jsr's built-in enforcement and skip gates where npm-specific
data is unavailable.

If the dependency audit does not run (e.g. cached push without re-audit), the
factor defaults to `missing` — no free points.

### `verified-by-swamp` (1 pt)

Earned in one of two ways:

1. The extension is published under the `@swamp` namespace (the first-party
   collective), OR
2. A Swamp Club admin has explicitly marked the extension verified via a
   curation endpoint (not yet built)

Third-party authors should not try to earn this factor. It is the deliberate gap
between 93% and 100%.

## Factors in the codebase but not currently rendered

### `provenance` (1 pt, gated)

Earned when the extension was published from GitHub Actions with a
Sigstore-signed bundle verified by the server. Currently gated behind a feature
flag (`PROVENANCE_IN_RUBRIC = false`) because CLI-side signing support has not
shipped. When the CLI lands provenance support and the flag flips, the rubric
divisor becomes 16 and extensions published from CI earn an additional point.

## Worked example: a third-party extension that earns 93%

Manifest:

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
name: "@mycollective/my-extension"
version: "2026.04.22.1"
description: "One-sentence explanation of what this extension does."

repository: https://github.com/mycollective/my-extension

additionalFiles:
  - README.md
  - LICENSE

models:
  - my-model.ts

platforms:
  - linux-x86_64
  - darwin-aarch64
```

Factor results:

| Factor              | Earned | Reason                                       |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| has-readme          | 2/2    | README.md listed in additionalFiles          |
| readme-example      | 1/1    | README contains a usage code block           |
| rich-readme         | 1/1    | README is 1.2k chars with 3 code blocks      |
| symbols-docs        | 1/1    | All 8 exports documented (100%)              |
| fast-check          | 1/1    | Explicit return types, no private-type leaks |
| description         | 1/1    | Non-empty                                    |
| platforms-one       | 1/1    | 2 platforms listed                           |
| platforms-two       | 1/1    | 2 platforms listed                           |
| has-license         | 1/1    | LICENSE file in additionalFiles              |
| repository-verified | 2/2    | Public github.com URL                        |
| dependency-trust    | 2/2    | No deprecated or vulnerable npm deps         |
| verified-by-swamp   | 0/1    | Third-party, not admin-curated               |

**Total: 14/15 = 93% Grade A.**

## Ceiling with future provenance

Once `PROVENANCE_IN_RUBRIC` is enabled:

| State                          | Divisor | Third-party ceiling |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| Flags off (current)            | 15      | 14/15 = 93%         |
| Provenance on, publish from CI | 16      | 15/16 = 93%         |
| Provenance on, no CI publish   | 16      | 14/16 = 87%         |

When the flag flips, extensions not publishing from CI will see a 6% regression.
Authors who want to stay at 93% will need to switch to publishing via GitHub
Actions at that point.
