## Common Errors

### "No 'model' or 'extension' export found"

Must use a named export for either a model or extension:

```typescript
// Wrong
const model = { ... };

// Correct — new model type
export const model = { ... };

// Correct — extend existing type
export const extension = { ... };
```

### "Unknown resource spec" or "Unknown file spec"

When calling `writeResource(specName, data)` or `createFileWriter(specName)`,
the `specName` must match a key declared in the model's `resources` or `files`.
Declare specs on the model definition:

```typescript
export const model = {
  type: "@user/my-model",
  version: "2026.02.09.1",
  resources: {
    "result": {
      description: "Model output data",
      schema: z.object({ value: z.string() }),
      lifetime: "infinite",
      garbageCollection: 10,
    },
  },
  methods: {
    run: {
      description: "Run the model",
      arguments: InputSchema,
      execute: async (
        _args: Record<string, never>,
        context: {
          writeResource: (
            specName: string,
            name: string,
            data: Record<string, unknown>,
          ) => Promise<{ name: string }>;
        },
      ) => { ... },
    },
  },
};
```

### "Model type already registered"

Type name conflicts with built-in or another user model. Use unique collective
names:

```typescript
// Avoid
type: "@user/echo"; // May conflict with other users

// Use
type: "@myorg/echo"; // Use your own collective
```

### "Uses a reserved collective"

Reserved collectives (`swamp`, `si`) are for built-in types only:

```typescript
// Wrong - reserved collective
type: "swamp/my-model";
type: "@swamp/my-model";
type: "si/auth";
type: "@si/auth";

// Correct - use any other collective
type: "@myorg/my-model";
type: "myorg/my-model";
type: "digitalocean/app-platform";
```

### "Cannot extend unregistered model type: ..."

The extension targets a model type that isn't registered. Ensure the type string
matches exactly (e.g., `"command/shell"`, not `"shell"`). If extending a user
model, both files must be in the same models directory — models are loaded
before extensions automatically.

### "Method 'X' already exists on model type 'Y'"

The extension tries to add a method with the same name as an existing method.
Extensions can only add new methods, not override existing ones. Use a different
method name.

### "Duplicate method name 'X' within extension methods array"

The same method name appears in multiple elements of the `methods` array within
a single extension file. Each method name must be unique across all array
elements.

### "Duplicate data instance name"

This error occurs when two `writeResource` or `createFileWriter` calls within
the same method execution use the same instance name, even across different
specs. Instance names map to storage paths on disk — the path has no spec
component, so `writeResource("summary", "bixu", ...)` and
`writeResource("repo", "bixu", ...)` both write to the same `bixu/` directory,
and the second overwrites the first.

**Fix:** Use unique instance names across all specs within a method. Prefix with
the spec name or another distinguishing value:

```typescript
// Wrong — same instance name across specs
await context.writeResource("summary", user.name, summaryData);
await context.writeResource("repo", repo.name, repoData);
// Fails when user.name === repo.name (e.g., both are "bixu")

// Correct — prefix ensures uniqueness
await context.writeResource("summary", `summary-${user.name}`, summaryData);
await context.writeResource("repo", `repo-${repo.name}`, repoData);
```

### "No such key: &lt;specName&gt;" in CEL expressions

This occurs when a CEL expression like
`model.<m>.resource.<specName>.<instanceName>.attributes.X` can't find the
resource. Common causes:

**1. Instance name mismatch.** The `name` parameter (second argument) passed to
`writeResource` determines the instance name. If you wrote
`writeResource("vpc", "my-vpc", data)`, the CEL path is
`model.<m>.resource.vpc.my-vpc.attributes.X`. Using just
`model.<m>.resource.vpc` won't work — you need the full path including instance
name.

```typescript
// Writes to spec "vpc" with instance name "main"
await context.writeResource("vpc", "main", data);
// CEL: model.<name>.resource.vpc.main.attributes.X
```

**2. Resource spec name contains hyphens.** CEL interprets hyphens as
subtraction, so `model.<m>.resource.internet-gateway` is parsed as
`resource.internet` minus `gateway`. Use camelCase or single words for spec
names (e.g., `igw`, `routeTable`).

**3. Model has never been executed.** The `resource` key on `model.<name>` is
only populated if the model has produced data (a method was run that called
`writeResource`). If no data exists, `model.<name>` has `input` and `definition`
keys but no `resource` key. Run the create method or workflow first, or check
with `swamp data list <model-name>` to verify data exists.

### "Property not found" in expression path validation

The expression path validator checks that referenced attributes exist in the
resource's Zod schema. If you use `z.object({}).passthrough()`, the schema has
no declared properties and the validator can't resolve paths like
`attributes.VpcId`. Declare the properties you need to reference:

```typescript
// Wrong — validator can't resolve attributes.VpcId
schema: z.object({}).passthrough(),

// Correct — VpcId is declared, .passthrough() allows additional fields
schema: z.object({ VpcId: z.string() }).passthrough(),
```

### "Extension has formatting or lint issues"

When `swamp extension push` runs its quality checks and they fail, the push is
blocked:

```
Fix: Run `swamp extension fmt <manifest-path>` to auto-fix formatting and lint
issues, then retry the push.
```

If unfixable issues remain after running `fmt`, manually address the lint errors
shown in the output. Common causes include unused variables, missing return
types, or patterns that `deno lint --fix` cannot auto-correct.

You can also run `swamp extension fmt <manifest-path> --check` to preview issues
without modifying files.

### Syntax errors on load

Extension models are loaded as JavaScript at runtime. Avoid TypeScript-only
syntax:

```typescript
// Wrong - non-null assertion (!) causes SyntaxError
const handle = await context.writeResource!("state", "main", data);

// Correct - call without !
const handle = await context.writeResource("state", "main", data);

// Wrong - type annotations cause syntax error
execute: async (args: { id: string }, context: any) => { ... }

// Correct
execute: async (args, _context) => { ... }
```

## Configuration

Models directory priority:

| Priority | Method               | Example                          |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1        | Environment variable | `SWAMP_MODELS_DIR=./custom/path` |
| 2        | `.swamp.yaml` config | `modelsDir: "lib/models"`        |
| 3        | Default              | `extensions/models`              |

**The table above is the historical default and still applies to every existing
manifest.** A manifest with no `paths` field — or with the explicit
`paths.base: typedDir` — uses this priority chain to find the configured models
directory. Only manifests that explicitly opt in with `paths.base: manifest`
skip the table entirely and resolve typed keys (`models`, `vaults`,
`datastores`, `reports`, `include`) relative to the manifest's own directory.
Default behavior is unchanged. See
[extension-publish references/publishing.md](../../../extension-publish/references/publishing.md#path-resolution--pathsbase)
for the canonical reference.

## Auto-Resolution Failures

Extensions from trusted collectives (the explicit `trustedCollectives` list in
`.swamp.yaml`; only `swamp` by default) auto-resolve on first use. Membership
collectives are not trusted automatically — run
`swamp extension trust add <collective>` first. If auto-resolution fails:

| Symptom                       | Cause                                      | Fix                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "no matching extension found" | Extension doesn't exist in registry        | `swamp extension search <query>` to find correct name                            |
| Network/timeout error         | Can't reach swamp.club                     | Check connectivity; manual: `swamp extension pull @name`                         |
| Type not auto-resolving       | Collective not trusted                     | `swamp extension trust list` to check, `swamp extension trust add <name>` to add |
| Silent "Unknown model type"   | Type uses non-`@` prefix or single segment | Use `@collective/name` format                                                    |
| Stale membership              | Collectives changed since last login       | Run `swamp auth whoami` to refresh cached collectives                            |

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify model loads
swamp model type search --json

# Check model schema
swamp model type describe @myorg/my-model --json

# Test the model
swamp model create @myorg/my-model test --set fieldName="test" --json
swamp model method run test methodName
```
