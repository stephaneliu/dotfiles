## The diagnostic loop

### Before you start — Version-drift check

Before entering the tiers, check whether the swamp binary or any installed
extensions are out of date. A stale version is the most common "invisible" root
cause — the fix may already ship in a newer release.

→ See [references/version-check.md](references/version-check.md).

### Tier 1 — Health checks

For symptoms tied to a known integration (audit pipeline, extension loading).
The doctor commands name the failing piece directly and exit non-zero on
failure. Cheapest tier, fastest signal.

→ See [references/health-checks.md](references/health-checks.md).

### Tier 2 — Error inspection

For specific command failures and unexpected output. Read stderr, switch to
`--json`, check exit codes, grep for `swamp-warning:` lines. Most failures are
loud — the error surface itself usually answers the question.

→ See [references/error-inspection.md](references/error-inspection.md).

### Tier 3 — Tracing

For timing and flow questions: slow workflows, mysterious waits, "where is this
spending its time?" Enable OpenTelemetry tracing and read the span hierarchy.
Not for diagnosing errors — for understanding execution shape.

→ See [references/tracing.md](references/tracing.md).

### Tier 4 — Source reading

For questions Tiers 1–3 can't answer, and for "how does X work internally?"
questions where `swamp <command> --help` is insufficient. Fetch swamp's source
with `swamp source fetch` and read the implementation. Most expensive tier —
reach for it last.

## Symptom → tier index

| Symptom                                                  | Start at                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extension or binary misbehaves unexpectedly              | Before you start → version-drift check                    |
| "This used to work" / suspected regression               | Before you start → version-drift check                    |
| Audit log empty / hooks not firing                       | Tier 1 → `swamp doctor audit`                             |
| Extension model/vault/driver/datastore/report not loaded | Tier 1 → `swamp doctor extensions`                        |
| `swamp-warning:` line on stderr                          | Tier 1 → `swamp doctor extensions`                        |
| CI preflight needs to gate on integration health         | Tier 1 → either doctor with `--json`                      |
| Run stuck in "running" / orphaned after crash            | Tier 1 → `swamp run doctor --fix`                         |
| "Is anything running right now?"                         | Tier 1 → `swamp run history --active`                     |
| Command errored — message is clear                       | Tier 2 → read it, fix the named issue                     |
| Command errored — message is vague or unhelpful          | Tier 2 → re-run with `--json`, then escalate              |
| Item "not found" / "not in search results"               | Tier 2 → check stderr for `swamp-warning:`                |
| Method failed `Pre-flight check failed: …`               | Tier 2 → see [references/checks.md](references/checks.md) |
| Model method or workflow run failed                      | Tier 2 → inspect generated reports                        |
| Workflow / method / sync is slow                         | Tier 3 → enable tracing                                   |
| "Where is this spending its time?"                       | Tier 3 → enable tracing                                   |
| Need to understand internal behavior of a command        | Tier 4 → fetch source                                     |
| Tier-1-clean integration that still misbehaves           | Tier 4 → fetch source                                     |

## Diagnostic playbook

For a typical investigation:

1. Match the symptom against the index above. If a tier is named, jump there.
2. If no tier matches, run Tier 2 (error inspection) — read stderr and switch to
   `--json` first.
3. Capture what each tier ruled out before escalating, so the next tier has
   context.
4. Once the root cause is identified, state it clearly, suggest a fix or
   workaround, and (if it's a bug) summarize for an issue report.
