# Swamp Troubleshooting

Diagnose swamp problems by working through four diagnostic tiers, cheapest
first. Each tier answers a different kind of question; escalate only when the
current tier doesn't resolve the issue.

**Verify CLI syntax:** If unsure about exact flags or subcommands, run
`swamp help <command>` for the up-to-date schema. Every swamp command supports
both `log` (default, human-readable) and `--json` (structured) output, and
returns non-zero on user-facing failure.

## Before you start: version-drift check

Before entering the diagnostic tiers, check whether the swamp binary or any
installed extensions are out of date. A stale version is a common root cause —
the fix may already exist in a newer release, and the check takes seconds.

```bash
swamp update --check          # is the swamp binary up to date?
swamp extension outdated      # are any extensions behind their latest version?
```

- If either reports an update is available, run `swamp update` and/or
  `swamp extension pull <name>` to get the latest, then retry the failing
  operation before continuing.
- If both report up to date (or the commands fail), proceed to the diagnostic
  tiers below.

For the full procedure (JSON output interpretation, what to do when updates are
found), see [references/version-check.md](references/version-check.md).

## Diagnostic mindset

- **Start cheap, escalate.** Don't fetch source when a doctor command would name
  the problem in seconds.
- **Read what's already on screen.** Stderr, exit codes, and `--json` output
  carry most of the answer.
- **Don't skip tiers.** Tracing without first reading the error is guessing;
  fetching source without trying `--json` is overkill.
- **One symptom, one tier.** If a symptom matches the table below, jump directly
  to that tier — don't run the loop top to bottom.

## The Four Tiers

| Tier                | When to use                          | Key tool                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Health checks    | Known integration issues, stale runs | `swamp doctor extensions`, `swamp run doctor` |
| 2. Error inspection | Command failures, unexpected output  | stderr, `--json`, exit codes                  |
| 3. Tracing          | Slow workflows, timing questions     | OpenTelemetry spans                           |
| 4. Source reading   | Internal behavior questions          | `swamp source fetch`                          |

## Symptom → tier index

| Symptom                                           | Start at                               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Extension or binary misbehaves unexpectedly       | Before you start → version-drift check |
| "This used to work" / suspected regression        | Before you start → version-drift check |
| Extension not loaded / `swamp-warning:` on stderr | Tier 1 → `swamp doctor extensions`     |
| Run stuck in "running" / orphaned after crash     | Tier 1 → `swamp run doctor --fix`      |
| "Is anything running right now?"                  | Tier 1 → `swamp run history --active`  |
| Command errored — message is clear                | Tier 2 → read it, fix the named issue  |
| Command errored — message is vague                | Tier 2 → re-run with `--json`          |
| Model method or workflow run failed               | Tier 2 → inspect generated reports     |
| Workflow / method / sync is slow                  | Tier 3 → enable tracing                |
| Need to understand internal behavior              | Tier 4 → fetch source                  |
