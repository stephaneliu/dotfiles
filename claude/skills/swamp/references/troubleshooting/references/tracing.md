# Tracing (Tier 3)

Reach for tracing when the question is about timing, flow, or where a slow
operation is spending its time. Tier 1 (health checks) and Tier 2 (error
inspection) handle most failures; tracing is for everything where the answer is
"how long" or "what ran when." Tracing is opt-in via environment variables and
has zero overhead when disabled.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Local Jaeger (run once)
docker run -d --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 -p 4318:4318 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest

# Enable tracing for any swamp command
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 swamp workflow run my-workflow

# View traces at http://localhost:16686 — search for service "swamp"
```

## When to Use Tracing

Tracing is most useful when:

- A workflow run is slow and you need to identify which step/method is the
  bottleneck
- Extension model methods are timing out and you need to see the full execution
  timeline
- Datastore sync (S3 pull/push) is slow and you want to measure lock acquisition
  and transfer times
- `data gc` is taking too long and you want to see how many entries are being
  processed
- Extension pull/push is failing and you want to see which network phase fails
- You need to trace context across Docker container boundaries to connect
  extension spans to the parent workflow

## Configuration

| Variable                      | Purpose                                  | Default         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Collector URL (telemetry off when unset) | _(unset = off)_ |
| `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`        | `otlp`, `console`, or `none`             | `otlp`          |
| `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`          | `otlp`, `console` (stderr), or `none`    | `otlp`          |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`           | Service name for traces and logs         | `swamp`         |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`  | Auth headers (`key=val,key=val`)         | _(none)_        |
| `OTEL_BLRP_USE`               | Batch log exports (`1` to enable)        | _(per-record)_  |

### Logs Signal

With an OTLP endpoint set, swamp also exports its structured log lines as OTel
log records, each correlated with the active `trace_id`/`span_id` so logs sit
next to their spans in the backend. Run secrets are redacted before export.
Disable with `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none` (traces stay on); batch with
`OTEL_BLRP_USE=1` for long-running `swamp serve`. If logs aren't arriving, check
that the endpoint is set, `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` is not `none`, and the collector
accepts `POST /v1/logs`.

### Console Exporter (No Collector Needed)

For quick debugging without running a collector:

```bash
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=console swamp workflow run my-workflow
```

Spans are printed to stderr in a readable format showing traceId, parentId,
name, duration, and attributes.

### Cloud Providers

```bash
# Honeycomb
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY"

# Grafana Cloud
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-0.grafana.net/otlp
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic YOUR_BASE64_TOKEN"
```

## What Gets Traced

### Workflow Execution Hierarchy

```
swamp.cli "workflow run"
  └─ swamp.workflow.run.command
       └─ swamp.workflow.run "deploy"
            ├─ swamp.workflow.evaluate
            ├─ swamp.workflow.job "build"
            │    ├─ swamp.workflow.step "compile" (20ms)
            │    │    └─ swamp.model.method → swamp.driver.execute
            │    └─ swamp.workflow.step "test" (parallel, 45ms)
            │         └─ swamp.model.method → swamp.driver.execute
            └─ swamp.workflow.job "deploy" (starts after build)
                 └─ swamp.workflow.step "apply"
                      └─ swamp.model.method → swamp.driver.execute
```

### All CLI Operations

Every libswamp generator is traced. Key span names:

- `swamp.model.method.run` — standalone model method execution
- `swamp.data.gc` — garbage collection (attributes: entries expired, bytes
  reclaimed)
- `swamp.extension.pull` / `.push` — registry network operations
- `swamp.datastore.sync` — S3 pull/push (attributes: direction, file count)
- `swamp.lock.acquire` — distributed lock acquisition
- `swamp.vault.put` / `.get` — secret storage/retrieval

## Diagnosing Common Issues

### Slow Workflow Runs

1. Enable tracing and run the workflow
2. In Jaeger, find the trace and look at the waterfall view
3. Identify which `swamp.workflow.step` spans are longest
4. Drill into `swamp.model.method` → `swamp.driver.execute` to see if the method
   itself is slow or if it's lock/sync overhead

### Slow Data GC

Look at the `swamp.data.gc` span attributes:

- `gc.entries_expired` — how many entries were processed
- `gc.versions_deleted` — how many versions were cleaned up
- `gc.bytes_reclaimed` — total bytes freed

### Extension Pull/Push Failures

The `swamp.extension.pull` and `swamp.extension.push` spans show the full
network operation. Push has three phases (initiate → upload → confirm) — the
span status and error message indicate which phase failed.

### Lock Contention

If `swamp.lock.acquire` spans are long, another process is holding the lock.
Check with `swamp datastore lock status` to see the current holder.

### Docker Driver Trace Propagation

When using `driver: docker`, swamp automatically sets `TRACEPARENT` as a
container environment variable. Extensions running in Docker that initialize
their own OTel SDK can read this env var to connect their spans to the parent
trace, creating a unified trace across process boundaries.

hierarchy, instrumentation points, and attribute reference.

## Escalating to other tiers

If tracing shows the timing but not the cause:

- **Span attributes hint at a known integration failure** → Tier 1:
  [health-checks.md](health-checks.md).
- **Span error messages need decoding, or `--json` output would say more** →
  Tier 2: [error-inspection.md](error-inspection.md).
- **The span is fast but the behavior is still wrong** → Tier 4:
  [source-reading.md](source-reading.md) — read the implementation directly.
