```

**Top-level directories** (`models/`, `workflows/`, `vaults/`): Source-of-truth
YAML files. These are committed to git and reviewed in PRs.

**`.swamp/` directory**: Runtime data only. Can be gitignored entirely. When an
external datastore is configured, this data lives elsewhere (see Datastores
section below).

## Initialize a Repository

Create a new swamp repository with all required directories and configuration.

```bash
swamp repo init --json
swamp repo init ./my-automation --json
```

### Multi-tool repos

`--tool` is repeatable to enroll multiple AI agent tools (Claude Code, Kiro,
Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Copilot) in the same repo. Each tool's scaffolding
(skills directory, instructions file, settings/hooks) is written independently
since the paths don't overlap. The marker stores the full enrolled list as
`tools: [...]`.

```bash
# Enroll one tool (default: claude)
swamp repo init --json

# Enroll multiple tools at once
swamp repo init --tool claude --tool kiro --json

# Skip tool scaffolding
swamp repo init --tool none --json
```

The **primary tool** is the first entry in `marker.tools` — it's used by
commands that still operate on a single tool (audit recording, extension skills
directory resolution). Order is preserved; appending a tool keeps the existing
primary stable.

Duplicate `--tool` values are silently collapsed. `--tool none` cannot be
combined with other `--tool` values.

### Instructions mode

Each tool's instructions file uses one of two modes that control how
`repo upgrade` handles the file:

- **`shared`** — swamp manages a marked section
  (`<!-- BEGIN swamp managed
  section -->` / `<!-- END ... -->`) inside the
  file, preserving any user content outside the markers. Used by all built-in
  tools (Claude, Cursor, Kiro, OpenCode, Codex, Copilot).
- **`owned`** — swamp fully controls the file and overwrites it on every
  `repo upgrade`. No user content is preserved. Used when you explicitly want
  swamp to own the entire file.

For custom tools defined via `swamp agent setup`, the wizard asks which mode to
use. The default is derived from the filename: root-level files matching a known
set (`AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`) default to
`shared`; all other paths default to `owned`.

To override the mode after setup, edit `.swamp-custom-tools.yaml` directly:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: mytool
    instructionsFile: .mytool/rules/swamp.md
    instructionsMode: shared # or "owned"
    skillsDir: .mytool/skills
    skillReferenceStyle: path
```

Use `swamp agent list` to see the current mode for each custom tool.

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "path": "/home/user/my-automation",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "created": [".swamp/", "extensions/models/", ".swamp.yaml", "CLAUDE.md"]
}
```

**What gets created:**

- `.swamp/` directory structure for internal storage
- `extensions/models/` directory for custom model types
- `.swamp.yaml` configuration file with version metadata
- `CLAUDE.md` with agent instructions and skill references
- `.gitignore` entries for `.swamp/` and `.swamp-sources.yaml`

### Verify the audit integration

Run `swamp doctor audit` after `init --tool <name>` and after upgrading the
external AI tool. Exits 1 on any check fail — safe to gate in CI. For the full
diagnostic flow (preflight checks, output shapes, common failures, escalation to
other tiers), see the `swamp-troubleshooting` skill's
`references/health-checks.md`.

## Upgrade a Repository

Update an existing repository to the latest swamp version. This updates skills,
configuration files, and migrates data if necessary.

```bash
swamp repo upgrade --json
swamp repo upgrade ./my-automation --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "path": "/home/user/my-automation",
  "previousVersion": "0.0.9",
  "newVersion": "0.1.0",
  "updated": [".claude/skills/swamp-model/", "CLAUDE.md"]
}
```

Run `swamp repo upgrade` after updating the swamp binary to ensure your
repository has the latest skill files and configuration.

`--tool` on `swamp repo upgrade` has **replace semantics** — the value(s) you
pass become the full enrolled tool list. Plain `swamp repo upgrade` with no
`--tool` flag preserves `marker.tools` and just bumps the version, re-syncing
scaffolding for every enrolled tool.

```bash
# Just bump the version, preserve the enrolled tools
swamp repo upgrade

# Add kiro to a [claude] repo (must list the full intended set)
swamp repo upgrade --tool claude --tool kiro

# Drop kiro from a [claude, kiro] repo
swamp repo upgrade --tool claude

# Clear all enrolled tools (drops scaffolding files stay on disk)
swamp repo upgrade --tool none
```

Dropping a tool from the list does **not** delete its on-disk files (`.kiro/`,
etc.) — remove them by hand if desired. Adding a tool that didn't share a skills
directory with the previous primary surfaces an `extensionsToReinstall` warning
naming pulled extensions that need to be re-installed for the new tool.

Legacy extension layouts are automatically migrated during upgrade. See
[references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for details on
legacy layout migration behavior.

## Start Web Interface

Launch a local web server for browsing and managing the repository.

```bash
swamp repo webapp --json
swamp repo webapp ./my-automation --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:8080",
  "path": "/home/user/my-automation"
}
```

## Datastores

Runtime data (model data, workflow runs, outputs, audit logs) is stored in a
configurable **datastore**. By default, this is the local `.swamp/` directory.

### Checking Status

```bash
swamp datastore status --json
```

**Output shape:**

```json
{
  "type": "filesystem",
  "path": "/home/user/my-repo/.swamp",
  "healthy": true,
  "message": "OK",
  "latencyMs": 1,
  "directories": ["data", "outputs", "workflow-runs", "..."]
}
```

### Setting Up a Filesystem Datastore

Move runtime data to an external directory (e.g. shared NFS mount):

```bash
swamp datastore setup filesystem --path /mnt/shared/swamp-data --json
```

Migrates existing `.swamp/` runtime data to the new path and updates
`.swamp.yaml`. Use `--skip-migration` to skip the data copy.

### Setting Up an Extension Datastore (e.g., S3)

Store runtime data in S3 for team collaboration using the `@swamp/s3-datastore`
extension:

```bash
swamp datastore setup extension @swamp/s3-datastore \
  --config '{"bucket":"my-bucket","prefix":"my-project","region":"us-east-1"}' --json
```

Verifies the backend, migrates local data to the remote, hydrates the local
cache, and updates `.swamp.yaml`. Subsequent commands automatically sync. See
[references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for
`--skip-migration` behavior and edge cases.

### Migrating Between Datastores

1. Check current status: `swamp datastore status --json`
2. Run setup with new backend: `swamp datastore setup <type> ... --json`
3. Verify health: `swamp datastore status --json` — confirm `healthy: true`
4. If unhealthy: check error message, fix credentials/paths, re-run setup

### Manual S3 Sync

```bash
swamp datastore sync --json         # Bidirectional sync
swamp datastore sync --pull --json  # Pull-only
swamp datastore sync --push --json  # Push-only
```

The `filesPulled` and `filesPushed` counts in the output reflect work the sync
command itself performed — they do not double-count any implicit pre-command
sync from other commands, and they are not a no-op summary.

### Lock Management

Datastores use a distributed lock to prevent concurrent write access. Locks
auto-expire after 30 seconds if a process crashes.

```bash
swamp datastore lock status --json           # Show lock holder
swamp datastore lock release --force --json  # Force-release stuck lock
```

After releasing a stuck lock, verify it cleared:

```bash
swamp datastore lock status --json  # Should return null
```

See [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for lock
internals and which commands acquire vs skip the lock.

### Environment Variable Override

For CI/CD, override the datastore without modifying `.swamp.yaml`:

```bash
export SWAMP_DATASTORE=s3:my-bucket/my-prefix
export SWAMP_DATASTORE=filesystem:/tmp/swamp-data
export SWAMP_DATASTORE='@myorg/my-store:{"key":"val"}'
```

For custom datastore or driver implementations, see the `swamp-extension` skill.

### Namespaces (Multi-Repo Datastores)

When multiple repos share a remote datastore, each must own a **namespace** to
avoid index collisions. Without namespaces, two repos writing to the same prefix
clobber each other's `.datastore-index.json`.

```bash
swamp datastore namespace set <slug> --json            # Assign namespace
swamp datastore namespace migrate --confirm --json     # Move data to namespaced layout
swamp datastore namespace list --json                  # List all namespaces
swamp datastore namespace unset --json                 # Remove namespace
swamp datastore catalog pull --namespaces <list> --json # Pull foreign catalogs
```

Standard multi-repo flow (new shared setups):

```bash
swamp datastore setup extension @swamp/s3-datastore \
  --namespace infra \
  --config '{"bucket":"shared-bucket","prefix":"swamp","region":"us-east-1"}'
```

For the full command reference, output shapes, and cross-namespace data access,
see [references/namespaces.md](references/namespaces.md).

## Extension Sources

Load extensions from external filesystem paths without copying files. Use this
when testing extensions from a separate development repo, using private
extensions that can't be published to swamp.club, or composing extensions from
multiple locations.

### `.swamp-sources.yaml`

A gitignored file at the repo root. Each entry is a **source** — a path (or
glob) pointing at a directory that contains extensions. Always added to
`.gitignore` by `swamp repo init` and `swamp repo upgrade`.

```yaml
sources:
  - path: ~/code/systeminit/swamp-extensions/model/aws/*
  - path: ~/code/acme-corp/internal-extensions/model/*
  - path: ~/code/my-experimental-vault
    only: [vaults]
```

**Fields:**

- `path` — filesystem path that contains extensions. Supports `~`, `$VAR`, and
  glob patterns (`*`, `**`). Two layouts are accepted:
  1. **Repo root**: a directory with `extensions/<kind>/` subdirectories. Most
     common — matches how published extensions are structured.
  2. **Direct content**: a directory whose files declare extension exports
     (`export const model = …`, `export const vault = …`, etc.) or workflow
     YAML. Useful when you want to point at a single-kind development tree or at
     an `extensions/<kind>/` directory directly. When both layouts exist in the
     same directory, the repo-root layout wins — the direct-content files at the
     root are ignored to prevent double-loading.
- `only` — optional filter limiting which extension types to load from this
  source: `models`, `vaults`, `drivers`, `datastores`, `reports`, `workflows`.

### Managing Sources

```bash
# Add a source (creates .swamp-sources.yaml if needed)
swamp extension source add ~/code/swamp-extensions/model/aws/ec2

# Add with glob (all AWS extensions)
swamp extension source add "~/code/swamp-extensions/model/aws/*"

# Add a directory that contains extension files directly (no extensions/ tree)
swamp extension source add ~/code/my-extensions/vault

# Add with type filter
swamp extension source add ~/code/my-vaults --only vaults

# List sources with status
swamp extension source list

# Remove a source
swamp extension source rm "~/code/swamp-extensions/model/aws/*"
```

`swamp extension source add` fails with a clear error if the path contributes no
extensions, so misconfigured paths are caught at add time rather than silently
ignored. After adding, verify the source loaded:

```bash
swamp extension source list --json  # Confirm the new source appears
```

### Load Order

1. **Local extensions** (`extensions/models/`, etc.)
2. **Source extensions** (from `.swamp-sources.yaml`, in order listed)
3. **Pulled extensions** (`.swamp/pulled-extensions/`)

Load order is unchanged. Sources override pulled extensions of the same type.
This means you can pull `@swamp/aws/ec2` from the registry, then add a source
pointing at your local development copy — your local version loads instead.
