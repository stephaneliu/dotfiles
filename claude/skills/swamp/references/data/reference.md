## Query Data

Use `swamp data query` with CEL predicates for filtering and `--select` for
projection. See [references/fields.md](references/fields.md) for all filterable
fields and CEL operators.

```bash
# By model
swamp data query 'modelName == "my-model"'

# By type and tags
swamp data query 'dataType == "resource" && tags.env == "prod"'

# With projection — extract specific fields
swamp data query 'modelName == "scanner"' --select '{"name": name, "os": attributes.os}'

# By content
swamp data query 'attributes.status == "failed"' --select 'name'

# History — all versions of a specific data item
swamp data query 'modelName == "my-model" && name == "state" && version >= 0' --select 'version'

# Interactive mode — TUI with live autocomplete, no predicate needed
swamp data query
```

## List Model Data

View all data items for a model, grouped by tag type. Shortcut for
`swamp data query 'modelName == "<model>"'`.

```bash
swamp data list my-model --json
```

**Output shape:** Returns `modelId`, `modelName`, `modelType`, `groups` (items
grouped by type tag, each with `id`, `name`, `version`, `size`, `createdAt`),
and `total`. See
[references/output-shapes.md](references/output-shapes.md#list-data) for the
full output shape.

## Get Specific Data

Retrieve the latest version of a specific data item. Shortcut for
`swamp data query 'modelName == "<model>" && name == "<name>"' --select content`
(omit `--select content` to return metadata only).

```bash
swamp data get my-model execution-log --json

# Metadata only (no content)
swamp data get my-model execution-log --no-content --json
```

**Output shape:** Returns `id`, `name`, `modelId`, `version`, `contentType`,
`lifetime`, `tags`, `ownerDefinition`, `size`, `checksum`, and `content`. See
[references/output-shapes.md](references/output-shapes.md#get-data) for the full
output shape.

## Workflow-Scoped Data Access

List or get data produced by a workflow run instead of specifying a model.

```bash
# List all data from the latest run of a workflow
swamp data list --workflow test-data-fetch --json

# List data from a specific run
swamp data list --workflow test-data-fetch --run <run_id> --json

# Get specific data by name from a workflow run
swamp data get --workflow test-data-fetch output --json

# Get with specific version
swamp data get --workflow test-data-fetch output --version 2 --json
```

## View Version History

See all versions of a specific data item. Shortcut for
`swamp data query 'modelName == "<model>" && name == "<name>" && version >= 0'`.

```bash
swamp data versions my-model state --json
```

**Output shape:** Returns `dataName`, `modelId`, `modelName`, `versions` (each
with `version`, `createdAt`, `size`, `checksum`, `isLatest`), and `total`. See
[references/output-shapes.md](references/output-shapes.md#versions) for the full
output shape.

## Rename Data

Data instance names are permanent once created — deleting and recreating under a
new name loses version history and breaks any workflows or expressions that
reference the old name. Use `data rename` to non-destructively rename with
backwards-compatible forwarding. The old name becomes a forward reference that
transparently resolves to the new name.

**When to rename:**

- Refactoring naming conventions (e.g., `web-vpc` → `dev-web-vpc`)
- Reorganizing data after a model's purpose evolves
- Fixing typos in data names without losing history

**Rename workflow:**

1. **Verify** the new name doesn't already exist:
   ```bash
   swamp data get my-model new-name --no-content --json
   ```
   This should return an error (not found). If it succeeds, the name is taken.
2. **Rename** the data instance:
   ```bash
   swamp data rename my-model old-name new-name
   ```
3. **Confirm** the forward reference works:
   ```bash
   swamp data get my-model old-name --no-content --json
   ```
   Should resolve to `new-name` via the forward reference.

**What happens:**

1. Latest version of `old-name` is copied to `new-name` (version 1)
2. A tombstone is written on `old-name` with a `renamedTo` forward reference
3. Future lookups of `old-name` transparently resolve to `new-name`
4. Historical versions of `old-name` remain accessible via
   `data.version("model", "old-name", N)`

**Forward reference behavior:**

- `data.latest("model", "old-name")` → resolves to `new-name` automatically
- `data.version("model", "old-name", 2)` → returns original version 2 (no
  forwarding)
- `model.<name>.resource.<spec>.<old-name>` → resolves to new name in
  expressions

**Important:** After renaming, update any workflows or models that produce data
under the old name. If a model re-runs and writes to the old name, it will
overwrite the forward reference.

## Delete Data

Permanently remove a data artifact from a model. The artifact identity is the
`(model, name)` pair — `swamp data delete` operates on that pair, not on
individual versions, unless `--version` is given.

**When to delete:**

- Re-running an `import` or `start` method that's blocked by an existing-state
  guard (e.g., `[NP-E028]`) when you want a clean re-import
- Removing data that was created in error
- Cleaning up after a destructive change to an external resource

**Default semantics:**

- `swamp data delete <model> <name>` — deletes **all versions** of the artifact.
  Prompts `[y/N]` with the exact version count before proceeding.
- `swamp data delete <model> <name> --version 3` — deletes only that single
  version. The artifact's other versions remain.
- `swamp data delete <model> <name> --force` — skips the confirmation prompt.
  Required in scripts, JSON mode, and any non-interactive context.

**Errors are loud, not silent:**

- Missing model → `Model not found: <ref>`
- Missing artifact → `No data named "<name>" exists for model <model>`
- Missing version →
  `Version <V> does not exist for "<name>" (available
  versions: 1, 2, 3)`

```bash
# Full-artifact delete with confirmation prompt
swamp data delete my-server hetzner-state

# Surgical single-version delete
swamp data delete my-server hetzner-state --version 2

# Non-interactive (scripts, automation)
swamp data delete my-server hetzner-state --force --json
```

**Note on rename forwarders:** If `oldName → newName` was renamed, deleting
`newName` leaves the tombstone on `oldName` forwarding to nothing. Lookups via
the forwarded path will return null. Delete the tombstone explicitly with
`swamp data delete <model> oldName` if you want a clean slate.

## Garbage Collection

Clean up expired data and old versions based on lifecycle settings.

**IMPORTANT: Always dry-run first.** GC deletes data permanently. Follow this
workflow:

1. **Preview** what will be deleted:
   ```bash
   swamp data gc --dry-run --json
   ```
2. **Review** the output — verify only expected items appear
3. **Run** the actual GC only after confirming the dry-run output:
   ```bash
   swamp data gc --json
   swamp data gc -f --json  # Skip confirmation prompt
   ```

**Dry-run output shape:** Returns `expiredDataCount` and `expiredData` (each
with `type`, `modelId`, `dataName`, `reason`). See
[references/output-shapes.md](references/output-shapes.md#gc-dry-run) for the
full output shape.

**GC output shape:** Returns `dataEntriesExpired`, `versionsDeleted`,
`bytesReclaimed`, and `expiredEntries`. See
[references/output-shapes.md](references/output-shapes.md#gc-run) for the full
output shape.

## Accessing Data in Expressions

CEL expressions access model data in workflows and model inputs. Functions,
examples, and key rules are in
[references/expressions.md](references/expressions.md).

## Data Ownership

Data is owned by the creating model — see
[references/data-ownership.md](references/data-ownership.md) for owner fields,
validation rules, and viewing ownership.

## Data Storage

Data is stored in the `.swamp/data/` directory:

```
.swamp/data/{normalized-type}/{model-id}/{data-name}/
  1/
    raw          # Actual data content
    metadata.yaml # Version metadata
  2/
    raw
    metadata.yaml
  latest → 2/    # Symlink to latest version
```
